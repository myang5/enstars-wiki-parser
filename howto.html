    <h2>TEXT GUIDELINES</h2>
    <h3>Text Tab</h3>
    <p>
      Copy and paste your translated chapter into the text box.
      <br>You can include whole-row images such as header image or CGs by inserting the EXACT file name (ex. (Resounding Beat) Jun Sazanami CG2.png) into the dialogue on its own line.
      <br>Here's an example:
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the header image.png
      <br>Person A: This is a line said by Person A! Their name is at the beginning of the line followed by a colon.
      <br>This is another line said by Person A (notice how it doesn't begin with their name).
      <br>Person B: This is a line said by another person!
      <br>This is screenshot of the game.jpeg
      <br>Person A: This is a third line from Person A.
    </p>

    <h3>Details Tab</h3>
    <p>Fill in information about the chapter and its
      appearance on the wiki. INSERT DIAGRAM OF WHAT EACH COLOR IS</p>

    <h3>Renders Tab</h3>
    <p>The renders tab should automatically display which characters are in the
      dialogue once you paste it into the text tab. Fill in the file names of the renders that
      should be used for each character. (ex. Tsukasa Suou School Dialogue Render.png)
      <br>NOTE: For now, if you want to use more than one render per character in one chapter,
      you have to format each section of the chapter with different renders separately.
      INSERT EXAMPLE

    <h2>CREATING A NEW PAGE ON THE WIKI</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Copy the text that shows up on the right-hand box (can be done with Ctrl+A/Cmd+A)</li>
      <li>Go to the cover page of the story and edit the URL to have the name
        of the chapter. <br>For example, https://www.ensemble-stars.wikia.com/wiki/Checkmate/CHAPTER TITLE</li>
      <li>
        Choose to create a new page.<br>
        <img src="./assets/howTo_createNewPage1.PNG">
      </li>
      <li>
        Instead of the visual editor, switch to the source editor.<br>
        <img src="./assets/howTo_createNewPage2.PNG">
      <li>
        Paste in the formatted text, and publish the page.<br>
        <img src="./assets/howTo_createNewPage3.PNG">
      </li>
      </li>
      <li>NOTE: As of now you must manually upload the header image of the
        chapter in the visual editor unless you upload the header image to
        the wiki before creating the new chapter page.</li>
